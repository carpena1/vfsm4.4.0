                        Vegetative Filter Strip Model

        -------------------------------------------------------------

VFSMOD was developed in the Department of Biological and Agricultural
Engineering by Dr. Rafael Munoz-Carpena under the direction of Dr. John E.
Parsons. The model and associated documentation is supplied as-is with no
warranty - explicit or implied. The model is provided to as an educational
and research tool. This version is the second moving the model from a
research tool to one available for general users. As with any model, the
results are totally dependent on the user's ability to wisely select input
parameters that represent the "field" and to interpret the results. We will
make every effort to provide assistance and encouragement as our other
commitments allow. We do ask that you reference our work if you find it
helpful in your pursuits.
