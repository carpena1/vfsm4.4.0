INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR VFSmod v3.x.x (SOURCE CODE)

1.-Obtaining VFSMOD
===================

VFSMOD documentation, source code and binaries for a number of 
platforms can be obtained in digital format through internet at 
the following URL site:

USA:	http://carpena.ifas.ufl.edu/vfsmod/

Go to the "Download..." link in model home page, register and you will be taken to the download page. The files needed are under the "FORTRAN Source Code for UH, VFSM" bullet (MS-DOS version) or "UNIX tarball" (unix version). If you do not have an internet connection you can 
contact the authors for assistance.


2.- Installing and running VFSMOD
=================================

VFSMOD (and UH) source code is distributed both in DOS and UNIX versions along with make files and sample input and output files. The source code is written entirely in standard FORTRAN77 so that compilation should be straight forward following the included makefile and using the proper set of files for each platform (DOS/UNIX). Binaries for a few computer platforms can also be found at the internet sites. 


2.1.- Installing in a DOS system (under MS-Windows '95 or later):
-----------------------------------------------------------------

a) Create a directory named VFSMOD
b) Expand the contents of the file vfsmodpc.zip. This should create the following directory structure
				VFSMOD
	SRC_VFSM	SRC_UH	DOCS	INPUTS		OUTPUT

c) The executable files VFSM.EXE (and UH.EXE) can be found in the parent directory VFSMOD.
d) Run the sample case named SAMPLE, by typing "VFSM SAMPLE" at the DOS prompt. Please note that the second part of the command issued (SAMPLE) refers to a set of files located in the subdirectory INPUTS. You could run a different problem by selecting a different set of input files with the condition that they are located in the subdirectory INPUTS. In this example, if you issue the DIR command within the INPUTS directory you should see the following files:

SAMPLE.IGR SAMPLE.IKW SAMPLE.IRN SAMPLE.IRO SAMPLE.ISD SAMPLE.ISO SAMPLE.IWQ

During the run a set of new files is created in the OUTPUT directory:

SAMPLE.OG1  SAMPLE.OG2  SAMPLE.OHY  SAMPLE.OSM  SAMPLE.OSP  SAMPLE.OWQ

The content of both input/output files is explained in detail in User's Manual.



2.2.-UNIX system:
-----------------

a) Create a directory named VFSMOD

	mkdir VFSMOD
	mv vfsmXXXux.tar.gz VFSMOD
	cd VFSMOD

b) Expand the contents of the file vfsm20ux.tar.gz on the new directory. 

	gzcat vfsmXXXux.tar.gz | tar xvf -

This should create the following directory structure
				VFSMOD
	src_vfsm	src_uh	docs	inputs		output

c) An installation script (setup) is included in the VFSMOD directory. To compile and install the program simply type setup. The script will compile the source code and copy the executable files (vfsm and uh) to the VFSMOD directory. If your FORTRAN compiler name is not f77 you will need to edit the makefile found in the src directories. You can also clean the executable and object files by typing setup clean.

d) Run the sample case named sample, by typing vfsm sample at the UNIX prompt.

Please note that the second part of the command issued (sample) refers to a set of files located in the subdirectory inputs. You could run a different problem by selecting a different set of input files with the condition that they are located in the subdirectory inputs. Note that you must have all the six input files in order to run the program. In our example, if you issue the ls command within the inputs directory you should see the following files:

sample.igr  sample.ikw  sample.irn  sample.iro  sample.isd  sample.iso sample.iwq

After you execute the command you should see a screen similar to the one given above. During the run a new set of files is created in the output directory:

sample.og1  sample.og2  sample.ohy  sample.osm  sample.osp sample.owq

The content of both input/output files is explained in detail 
in the User's Manual.
